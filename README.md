# ☕ Coffee Chain Sales Dashboard

An interactive and insightful dashboard built using **Power BI** to analyze the sales performance of a fictional coffee retail chain. This project demonstrates my ability to clean data, extract insights, and visualize key business metrics to support data-driven decision making.

## 📌 Project Motivation

In any retail business, understanding what drives **sales** and **profitability** is critical. This dashboard was developed to simulate a real-world scenario where a business wants to:

- Monitor regional sales performance
- Identify profitable and underperforming products
- Understand customer preferences by region and time
- Make informed decisions based on trends and KPIs

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with business intelligence tools and practical data analysis techniques that are essential for a **Data Analyst** role.
